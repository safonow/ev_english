<p class=MsoBodyText style='margin-right:0cm;line-height:97%'><span lang=EN-US>As
the adventurers stood <span style='background:yellow'>hesitating</span> what to
do Chiss stirred and suddenly a shower of quills came flying toward them,
almost filling <span style='color:black'>the air, they were so many. Scraps
realized in an instant that they had gone too near to Chiss for safety, so she <span
style='background:yellow'>sprang</span> in front of Ojo and shielded him from
the darts, which <span style='background:yellow'>stuck</span> their points into
her own body until she <span style='background:yellow'>resembled</span> one of
those <span style='background:yellow'>targets</span> they shoot arrows at in
archery games. The Shaggy Man dropped <span style='background:yellow'>flat</span>
on his face to <span style='background:yellow'>avoid</span> the shower, but one
quill struck him in the leg and went far in. As for the Glass Cat, the quills <span
style='background:yellow'>rattled off </span>her body without making even a
scratch, and the skin of the Woozy was so thick and tough that he was not hurt
at all.</span></span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText style='margin-right:0cm;text-indent:17.85pt;line-height:
97%'><span lang=EN-US style='color:black'>When the attack was over they all ran
to the Shaggy Man, who was <span style='background:yellow'>moaning</span> and <span
style='background:yellow'>groaning</span>, and Scraps <span style='background:
yellow'>promptly</span> pulled the quill out of his leg. Then up he jumped and
ran over to Chiss, putting his foot on the monster's neck. The body of the
great porcupine was now as smooth as leather, except for the holes where the
quills had been, for it had shot every single quill in that one wicked shower.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText style='margin-right:0cm;text-indent:17.85pt;line-height:
97%'><span lang=EN-US>&quot;Let me go!&quot; it shouted angrily. &quot;How <span
style='background:yellow'>dare</span> you put your foot on Chiss?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText style='margin-right:0cm;text-indent:17.85pt;line-height:
97%'><span lang=EN-US>&quot;I'm going to do worse than that, old boy,&quot;
replied the Shaggy Man. &quot;You have annoyed travelers on this road long
enough, and now I shall put an end to you.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText style='margin-right:0cm;text-indent:17.85pt;line-height:
97%'><span lang=EN-US>&quot;You can't!&quot; returned Chiss. &quot;Nothing can
kill me, as you know perfectly well.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText style='margin-right:0cm;text-indent:17.85pt;line-height:
97%'><span lang=EN-US>&quot;Perhaps that is true,&quot; said the Shaggy Man in
a tone of disappointment. &quot;Seems to me I've been told before that you
can't be killed. But if I let you go, what will you do?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText style='margin-right:0cm;text-indent:17.85pt;line-height:
97%'><span lang=EN-US>&quot;Pick up my quills again,&quot; said Chiss in a <span
style='background:yellow'>sulky</span> voice.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText style='margin-right:0cm;text-indent:17.85pt;line-height:
97%'><span lang=EN-US>&quot;And then shoot them at more travelers? No; that
won't do. You must promise me to stop throwing quills at people.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText style='margin-right:0cm;text-indent:17.85pt;line-height:
97%'><span lang=EN-US>&quot;I won't promise anything of the sort,&quot;
declared Chiss.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText style='margin-right:0cm;text-indent:17.85pt;line-height:
97%'><span lang=EN-US>&quot;Why not?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText style='margin-right:0cm;text-indent:17.85pt;line-height:
97%'><span lang=EN-US>&quot;Because it is my nature to throw quills, and every
animal must do what Nature <span style='background:yellow'>intends</span> it to
do. It isn't <span style='background:yellow'>fair</span> for you to <span
style='background:yellow'>blame</span> me. If it were wrong for me to throw
quills, then I wouldn't be made with quills to throw. The <span
style='background:yellow'>proper</span> thing for you to do is to <span
style='background:yellow'>keep out</span> of my way.&quot; &quot;Why, there's
some sense in that argument,&quot; <span style='background:yellow'>admitted</span>
the Shaggy Man, <span style='background:yellow'>thoughtfully</span>; &quot;but
people who are strangers, and don't know you are here, won't be able to keep
out of your way.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText style='margin-right:0cm;text-indent:17.85pt;line-height:
97%'><span lang=EN-US>&quot;Tell you what,&quot; said Scraps, who was trying to
pull the quills out of her own body, &quot;let's gather up all the quills and
take them away with us; then old Chiss won't have any left to throw at
people.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText style='margin-right:0cm;text-indent:17.85pt;line-height:
97%'><span lang=EN-US>&quot;Ah, that's a clever idea. You and Ojo must gather
up the quills while I hold Chiss a prisoner; for, if I let him go, he will get
some of his quills and be able to throw them again.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText style='margin-right:0cm;text-indent:17.85pt;line-height:
97%'><span lang=EN-US>So Scraps and Ojo picked up all the quills and tied them
in a bundle so they might easily be carried. After this the Shaggy Man released
Chiss and let him go, knowing that he was harmless to <span style='background:
yellow'>injure</span> anyone.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText style='margin-right:0cm;text-indent:17.85pt;line-height:
97%'><span lang=EN-US>&quot;It's the meanest trick I ever heard of,&quot;
muttered the porcupine gloomily. &quot;How would you like it, Shaggy Man, if I
took all your shags away from you?&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText style='margin-right:0cm;text-indent:17.85pt;line-height:
97%'><span lang=EN-US>&quot;If I threw my shags and hurt people, you would be
welcome to capture them,&quot; was the reply.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText style='margin-right:0cm;text-indent:17.85pt;line-height:
97%'><span lang=EN-US>Then they walked on and left Chiss standing in the road
sullen and disconsolate. The Shaggy Man <span style='color:red'>limped</span>
as he walked, for his wound still hurt him, and Scraps was much annoyed because
the quills had left a number of small holes in her patches.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText style='margin-right:0cm;text-indent:17.85pt;line-height:
97%'><span lang=EN-US>When they came to a flat stone by the roadside the Shaggy
Man sat down to rest, and then Ojo opened his basket and took out the bundle of
charms the Crooked Magician had given him.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText style='margin-right:0cm;text-indent:17.85pt;line-height:
97%'><span lang=EN-US>&quot;I am Ojo the Unlucky,&quot; he said, &quot;or we
would never have met that dreadful porcupine. But I will see if I can find
anything among these charms which will cure your leg.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText style='margin-right:0cm;text-indent:17.85pt;line-height:
97%'><span lang=EN-US>Soon he discovered that one of the charms was labelled:
&quot;For flesh wounds,&quot; and this the boy separated from the others. It
was only a bit of dried root, taken from some unknown <span style='background:
yellow'>shrub</span>, but the boy <span style='background:yellow'>rubbed it</span>
upon the wound made by the quill and in a few moments the place was healed <span
style='background:yellow'>entirely</span> and the Shaggy Man's leg was as good
as ever.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText style='margin-right:0cm;text-indent:17.85pt;line-height:
97%'><span lang=EN-US>&quot;<span style='background:yellow'>Rub it on</span>
the holes in my patches,&quot; suggested Scraps, and Ojo tried it, but without
any effect.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText style='margin-right:0cm;text-indent:17.85pt;line-height:
97%'><span lang=EN-US>&quot;The charm you need is a needle and thread,&quot;
said the Shaggy Man. &quot;But do not worry, my dear; those holes do not look
bad, at all.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText style='margin-right:0cm;text-indent:17.85pt;line-height:
97%'><span lang=EN-US>&quot;They'll let in the air, and I don't want people to
think I'm airy, or that I've been <span style='background:yellow'>stuck up</span>,&quot;
said the Patchwork Girl.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText style='margin-right:0cm;text-indent:17.85pt;line-height:
97%'><span lang=EN-US>&quot;You were certainly stuck up until we <span
style='background:yellow'>pulled out</span> those quills,&quot; observed Ojo,
with a laugh.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText style='margin-right:0cm;text-indent:17.85pt;line-height:
97%'><span lang=EN-US>So now they went on again and coming presently to a pond
of muddy water they tied a heavy stone to the bundle of quills and sunk it to
the bottom of the pond, to avoid carrying it farther.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText style='margin-top:12.0pt;margin-right:0cm;margin-bottom:

<p class=MsoBodyText style='margin-right:0cm;text-indent:17.85pt'><u><span
lang=EN-US style='color:#FF3399'>From here on [A]</span></u><span lang=EN-US> the
country improved and the desert places <u><span style='color:#FF3399'>began to
give way for [B]</span></u> fertile spots; still no houses were yet to be seen
near the road. There were some hills, with valleys between them, and on
reaching the top of one of these hills the travelers found before them a high
wall, running <u><span style='color:#FF3399'>to a right and a left [C]</span></u>
as far as their eyes could reach. Immediately in front of them, where the wall
crossed the roadway, stood a gate having stout iron bars that <u><span
style='color:#FF3399'>extended from top to bottom [D]</span></u>. They found,
on coming nearer, that this gate was locked with a great padlock, <u><span
style='color:#FF3399'>rusty through lack of use [E]</span></u>.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText style='margin-right:0cm;text-indent:17.85pt'><span
lang=EN-US>&quot;Well,&quot; said Scraps, &quot;I guess we'll stop here.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText style='margin-right:0cm;text-indent:17.85pt'><span
lang=EN-US>&quot;It's a good guess,&quot; replied Ojo. &quot;Our way <u><span
style='color:#FF3399'>has barred by [F] </span></u>this great wall and gate. It
looks as if <u><span style='color:#FF3399'>no one has passed through [G]</span></u>
in many years.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText style='margin-right:0cm;text-indent:17.85pt'><span
lang=EN-US>&quot;Looks are deceiving,&quot; declared the Shaggy Man, <u><span
style='color:#FF3399'>laughing at their disappointed faces [H]</span></u>,
&quot;and this barrier is the most deceiving thing in all Oz.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText style='margin-right:0cm;text-indent:17.85pt'><span
lang=EN-US>&quot;It prevents <u><span style='color:#FF3399'>our going any farther
[I]</span></u>, anyhow,&quot; said Scraps. &quot;There is no one to mind the
gate and let people through, and we've no key to the padlock.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText style='margin-right:0cm;text-indent:17.85pt'><span
lang=EN-US>&quot;True,&quot; replied Ojo, going a little nearer <u><span
style='color:#FF3399'>to peeping through [J]</span></u> the bars of the gate.
&quot;What shall we do, Shaggy Man? If we had wings, we <u><span
style='color:#FF3399'>might fly over the wall [K]</span></u>, but we cannot
climb it and unless we get to the Emerald City I won't be able to find <u><span
style='color:#FF3399'>the things for restoring [L]</span></u> Unc Nunkie to
life.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText style='margin-right:0cm;text-indent:17.85pt'><span
lang=EN-US>&quot;All very true,&quot; answered the Shaggy Man, quietly;
&quot;but I know this gate, I have passed <u><span style='color:#FF3399'>through
it a lot of times [M]</span></u>.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText style='margin-right:0cm;text-indent:17.85pt'><span
lang=EN-US>&quot;How?&quot; they all eagerly inquired.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText style='margin-right:0cm;text-indent:17.85pt'><span
lang=EN-US>&quot;I'll show you how,&quot; said he. He stood Ojo in the middle
of the road and placed Scraps just behind him, with her padded hands on his
shoulders. After the Patchwork Girl came the Woozy, who held a part of her
skirt in his mouth. Then, last of all, was the Glass Cat, holding fast to the
Woozy's tail <u><span style='color:#FF3399'>with her glass jaws [N]</span></u>.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText style='margin-right:0cm;text-indent:17.85pt'><span
lang=EN-US>&quot;Now,&quot; said the Shaggy Man, &quot;you must all shut your
eyes tight, and <u><span style='color:#FF3399'>keep them shutting [O]</span></u>
until I tell you to open them.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText style='margin-right:0cm;text-indent:17.85pt'><span
lang=EN-US>&quot;I can't,&quot; objected Scraps. &quot;My eyes are buttons, and
they won't shut.&quot;</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText style='margin-right:0cm;text-indent:17.85pt'><span
lang=EN-US>So the Shaggy Man <u><span style='color:#FF3399'>tied his red
handkerchief above [P]</span></u> the Patchwork Girl's eyes and examined all
the others to make sure they had their eyes fast shut and could see nothing.</span></p>

<p class=MsoBodyText style='margin-right:0cm;text-indent:17.85pt'><span
lang=EN-US>&quot;What's the game, anyhow – blind-man's-buff?&quot; asked
Scraps.</span></p>

word 'whale' is simply the modern spelling of an Anglo-Saxon word 'hwal' that
means 'the biggest'. The biggest whale also happenes to be the largest animal
in the world. It is the blue, or sulfur-bottom, whale, which may be more than 100 feet long and wigh 125 tons. It has no teeth. It may be found in all waters but is most common in
the Pacific Ocean. The grampus, or killer whale (which is really a large
dolphin), is the only one that eats other warm-blooded animals. It easily
catches seals. Packs of killer whales even attack large whales. </span></p>

</span>   <span lang=EN-US>Whales can stay under water for an hour or more. But
they have to swim up to the surface to replace the oxygen in their bodies as
they breathe air with their lungs. They store oxygen in their muscles and use
it when they dive. As they rise to the surface, they open the blowehole on top
of their head and blow out the used air. Then they take one or more deep
breaths. Underwater, the blowhole is closed.</span></p>

</span>   <span lang=EN-US>Most whales carry babies from 8 to 16 months or even
longer for big whales such as the blue whale. Usually only one offspring is
produced. The baby is born under water. It immediately rises to the surface to
take the firs breath of air. The baby suckles its mother's milk. Mother whales
take care of the young for weeks or even months. </span></p>

margin-left:21.3pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:-21.3pt'><span lang=EN-US>4.    Whales
are divided into two main groups by the different types of jaws and feeding
methods. Toothed whales have narrow lower jaws and cone-shaped pointed teeth.
The teeth number from 2 to 120 depending on the kind of whales. Toothed whales
feed mainly on fish and small sea animals. Whalebone whales have no teeth.
Instead they have up to 300 plates of horny material. These plates hang down
from the jaw and act as filters to sift out plankton, the tiny sea animals and
plants. When such whales are not feeding, the plates are hidden within the
broad lower jaw. </span></p>

      There are quite a lot of separate populations of whales. Some inhabit
just the Northern Hemisphere, others the Southern, and within each there are
Pacific, Atlantic and Indian Ocean groups. Groups of whales may travel many thousands
of miles each year following defrinite routs. These routs sometimes take them
close to the mainland or among the ice of polar regions. Most toothed whales
travel to keep up with the movements of the fish on which they feed. Among
toothless whales, the males move north in summer and return to the tropics in winter
for the breeding season.</span></p>

margin-left:21.3pt;margin-bottom:.0001pt;text-indent:-21.3pt'><span lang=EN-US>6.    Since
a whale lives in the water and has a fish-shaped body, why isn't it considered
a fish? The fact is that the whale is a water mammal, and is descended from
ancestors that lived on land. During the thousands and thousands of years they
have been living in the water, whales have grown to resemble fish in their
shape and other outside features, but they are built and they live like land
animals. A whale's flippers, for instance, have the bones of a five-fingered
hand. Some whales even have the bones of hind legs in their flesh. The most
important differnce between whales and fish, of course, is that the baby whale
is fed on its mother's milk like other little mammals. </span></p>
